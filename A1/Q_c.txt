No. 
For the first one, the last operation before the returning is an addition, not a recursive call.
For the second one, it's also not a recursive call.


Pseudo code:

FibonacciTailRecursion(n, first, second)
Input:  the n-th Fibonacci number we want to compute, the first Fibonacci number, the second Fibonacci number
Output: the n-th Fibonacci number

if n <= 0 then return first
else return FibonacciTailRecursion(n-1, second, first + second)
